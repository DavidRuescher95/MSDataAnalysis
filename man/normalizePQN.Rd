\usage{
normalizePQN(data, measure = c("median", "mean"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input data to be normalized. Usually a numeric matrix.}

\item{measure}{What measure to be used for the normalization factor.
Can be "median" or "mean".}
}
\value{
A matrix containing normalized values.
}
\description{
Probabilistsic quotient normalization (PQN) is a method to normalize data by
dividing each value within a sample by a normalization factor.
}
\details{
\deqn{normalization\_factor = median \left( \frac{value_{i,j}}{median(feature_i)} \right)}

Where \eqn{value_{i,j}} is the value of the i-th feature in the j-th sample and
\eqn{median(feature_i)} is the median of the i-th feature across all samples.

If measure = "mean", the normalization factor is calculated as:

\deqn{normalization\_factor = median \left( \frac{value_{i,j}}{mean(feature_i)} \right)}

The normalized matrix is then simply the quotient of a \eqn{value_{i,j}} by
the \eqn{normalization_factor_{j}} of a given sample j.

\deqn{normalized\_data = \frac{value_{i,j}}{normalization\_factor_j}}
}
